# Toolformer Zero

[![Toolformer Zero](preview.png)](https://toolformerzero.com)

React app implementing OpenAI and Google APIs to re-create behavior of the [toolformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04761) paper.

It does so using zero/few-shot prompting. No model-finetuning is needed, instead the entire "training" of the model is happening via prompt engineering.
